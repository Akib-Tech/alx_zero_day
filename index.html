        <h2>About The Visa Card Grant</h2>
        
        <p style="color:rgb(0,0,0);line-height:1.5;letter-spacing: 2px;font-family: sans-serif;">At One Vanilla Card,
             we believe in the power of education to transform lives. 
            Our non-refundable grant initiative is designed to address the financial barriers that many students face,
             ensuring that they can focus on what truly matters: their studies and personal growth.

            Reasons for the Grant Campaign:
            Supporting Educational Aspirations: Higher education can be a significant financial burden. Our grant helps 
            alleviate some of that stress, allowing students to pursue their academic dreams without the worry of 
            repayment.
            
            Fostering Financial Independence: By providing a grant that doesn’t need to be repaid,
             we empower students to take charge of their financial futures. This support encourages responsible financial 
             habits and lessens the burden of student debt.
